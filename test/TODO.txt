JDOM-TEST - TODO File
---------------------

* Currently the generator produces source files using the unix \n notation.
  should this be \n\r ?

* Need to upgrade ant to 1.1 and xerces to version ?.? in order to use the
  junit task. Which could be very useful indeed.

* Need to complete the GUI version of the generation tool, currently only
  works from the command line.

* Need to allow mutiple source classes in the command line.

* Need to check that the codegenerator works OK on M$/Mac platforms.

* Need to add a verify option to the codegenerator to check the validity
  of the test cases.

* Need to be able to find out which test cases have been coded and which 
  are pending by running the test suite.

* Need to find out if test cases can be created using a use case, how could this
  be done.

* Need to allow to test for many combinations of default, empty and fully 
  qualified namespace declarations matching all use cases specified in xml 
  namespaces rec from w3c

* Integrate combined test suites
