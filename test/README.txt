Introduction
============

jdom-test is the home for a set of automated test cases covering all aspects
of JDOM behavior, used to ensure the JDOM core library consistently behaves as
documented.  My expectation is that we'll run these tests before every
check-in.  Contributors with write access to the jdom-test module can be found
in COMMITTERS.txt.  Currently the module includes a set of autogenerated
classes (under the org.jdom.test package hierarchy) containing test hooks that
will be fleshed out and run with the third party JUnit library.  Your help in
fleshing out the test cases is most welcome.  Send patches to the
jdom-interest list.

Building instructions
=====================

Building jdom-test is the same as building jdom.  See the README.txt in the
jdom module.
